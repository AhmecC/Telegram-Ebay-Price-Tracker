# Telegram-Ebay-Price-Tracker

/track_new To Do List:
- Search the item and if 0 results come up then tell them a mistake was made and to retry
- search the item and inform the user of how many results came up (if low search results then make them confirm they want to still track)

/manage To Do List:
- Make output nice :)

/Actual Tracker Functionality:
- Search the item up on ebay and look at the top (not yet known) results every 6 hours
- For Buy-it=now items, inform the user if it satisfies target price
- For Bidding items, inform the user only if there is less than 6 hours of bidding left and it satisfies their target price
- Give a setting where they can either track both Buy-it-now or Bids or just one
